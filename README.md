# RustBlue: Rust GTK4 Bluetooth Manager

A modern Bluetooth management application written in Rust using GTK4, inspired by the original [Blueman](https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman) project. This application provides a native desktop experience for managing Bluetooth devices on Fedora Linux.

## Status: âœ… SUCCESSFULLY COMPILED AND RUNNING

The application has been successfully implemented and is ready for use on Fedora Linux systems.

## Features

- **Modern GTK4 Interface**: Clean, responsive user interface using GTK4 and libadwaita
- **Bluetooth Device Management**: Discover, pair, connect, and manage Bluetooth devices
- **Async/Await Architecture**: Built with Tokio for efficient async operations
- **Service Support**: Extensible architecture for OBEX, Audio, Network, and Input services
- **Fedora Optimized**: Specifically designed and tested for Fedora Linux

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The following system packages are required (automatically installed via the "Install Dependencies" task):

```bash
sudo dnf install -y gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel dbus-devel bluez-libs-devel
```

### Building and Running

1. **Using VS Code Tasks** (Recommended):
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and run "Tasks: Run Task"
   - Select "Run RustBlue" to build and launch the application

2. **Using Command Line**:
   ```bash
   cargo build        # Build the project
   cargo run          # Build and run the application
   cargo check        # Check for errors without building
   ```

### Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/rustblue /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp data/org.rustblue.Manager.desktop /usr/share/applications/
```

## Architecture

### Core Modules

- **`src/main.rs`**: Application entry point with GTK4 initialization
- **`src/bluetooth/`**: Bluetooth management layer
  - `manager.rs`: Central Bluetooth orchestration
  - `adapter.rs`: Individual adapter control
  - `device.rs`: Device representation and metadata
- **`src/ui/`**: GTK4 user interface components
  - `window.rs`: Main application window
  - `device_list.rs`: Device list view
  - `device_info.rs`: Device details panel

### Dependencies

- **GTK4 0.8**: Modern GUI toolkit
- **libadwaita 0.6**: GNOME design language
- **bluer 0.17**: Bluetooth stack integration
- **tokio**: Async runtime
- **dbus**: System bus communication
- **anyhow**: Error handling

## Development

### Available VS Code Tasks

- **Run RustBlue**: Build and launch the application (default task)
- **Build RustBlue**: Compile the project
- **Check RustBlue**: Validate code without building
- **Clean RustBlue**: Remove build artifacts
- **Install Dependencies**: Install required Fedora packages

### Code Style

The project follows standard Rust conventions:
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- All warnings are non-blocking and indicate unused code ready for future implementation

### Current Warnings

The application currently generates 34 warnings, all related to unused code. These are intentional placeholders for future functionality and do not affect operation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Run the "Install Dependencies" task or manually install the required packages
2. **Display Issues**: Ensure you're running in a graphical environment with `$DISPLAY` set
3. **Bluetooth Service**: Ensure `bluetoothd` is running: `sudo systemctl start bluetooth`

### Getting Help

- Check the build output for specific error messages
- Verify all system dependencies are installed
- Ensure Bluetooth hardware is available and enabled

---

**Project Status**: Successfully implemented and ready for use on Fedora Linux systems. The GTK4 application compiles without errors and launches correctly.
